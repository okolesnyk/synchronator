V0.4.0 beta2 2015-
    - Added back requirement for tail in ascii.
    - fixed the thread blocking issue during cancellation.
    - Added TCP support

V0.4.0 beta1 2015-08-30
    - Major restructure: organised code in separate files which makes it easier to
      add different interfaces than e.g. serial/rs232 and different processing methods,
      rather than the current ascii and numeric data. Also allows for easier reading,
      debugging, etc.
    - Added an i2c interface
    - Dropped the requirement for headers and tails in both ascii and numeric processing
      methods. This allows for volume only devices (i2c in particular).
    - Adding configuration options to exclude the message queue and serial interface
    - Some experimenting with coding styles.
    TODO
    - Testing, updating manuals, adding TCP support and systemd script
    - Threads may block trying to acquire a lock when a lock owning thread is canceled.
